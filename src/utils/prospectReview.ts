// ─── LeadPulse Intelligence — Prospect Review: shared, pure helpers ───
//
// This module is the ONLY place the Prospect Review screen derives its data.
// It deliberately mirrors scripts/prospect-fit-report.ts (the CLI) row-for-row, so
// the screen and the report cannot disagree about who is a candidate.
//
// Membership is deterministic (pre-gates in prospectFit.ts). Archetype fit is a
// Laya judgment made on explicit press — these helpers only SPLIT, ORDER and
// FILTER by that judgment; they never compute one, and they never rank by
// keyword.
//
// Two rules this file exists to enforce:
//   1. Nothing here hardcodes a count, a name, or a pilot finding. Everything is
//      computed from live CRM rows handed in by the caller.
//   2. Dimensions that have NO approved structured source are reported as
//      "not assessed", never as a fact. The local markdown pilot produced richer
//      dimensions (route quality, serviceability, relationship history, blockers)
//      and those are NOT app data.
